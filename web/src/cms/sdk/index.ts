/**
 * Payload SDK instance with caching support.
 * 
 * This cache will cache responses forever, which is acceptable because the SDK-level cache
 * is only used during static site building (SSG), not during preview or SSR requests.
 * This means cached data will be "baked into" the generated static site and won't impact 
 * local development or preview/SSR modes, which always request fresh data.
 * 
 * Caching is opt-in and controlled via RequestInit headers:
 * - Set `X-Use-Cache: 'true'` to enable caching (only for GET requests).
 * - Omit or set `X-Use-Cache: 'false'` to disable caching (default).
 * - POST requests are never cached, regardless of the header value.
